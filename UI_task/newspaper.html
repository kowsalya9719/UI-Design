            <p><u>Why You Should Go Electric</u></p>
            <p>You can help these cars truly become the future of transportation in a few ways. To start, pledge to go electric when buying your next car! As well, demand electric options at your local dealership–so you can test drive one as well as purchase one the next time you’re in the market for a vehicle. Additionally, share the graphic below on social media so that everyone in your network can do the same.</p>
            <p> Electric cars require less maintenance than cars that use gasoline. New models hitting the market also offer more flexibility in terms of car size and style for your electric vehicle.</p>
